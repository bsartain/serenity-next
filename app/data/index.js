    question: "What you can expect from a Professional Massage?",
    answer:
      "Whether this is your first massage or your 50th, your therapist will ask why you chose to come for a massage today. If this is your first massage at Serenity we will ask you to fill out a short intake form on your past and current physical conditions, medical history, life style, stress and areas of pain. We will show you to one of our treatments rooms, and give you some privacy where you can undress to your comfort level. You may or may not leave your undergarments on. Ladies will have to remove their bra so we can work on the entire back area. Once you undress slip underneath the sheet and blanket, face down with your face in the face cradle. We will knock on the door before we enter, giving us time to heat our spinal pillow. We will adjust the face cradle up or down if needed and the bolster should fit comfortably under your ankles. We will undrape only the area of the body we will be massaging, insuring your modesty is respected at all times. Breasts and genitals are NEVER exposed. During a 60 minute massage, we will be working on your entire body starting with the back and neck first. We will work on the glutes through the sheet, and then massage the backs of the legs and bottoms of the feet. We will step out of the room so you can turn over and we can heat our spinal pillow. We will return to work on the top of your legs and feet. Next we massage your arms, hands, neck, head and face. During a 30 minute massage, it’s impossible to cover the entire body so we can concentrate on what is hurting you the most, or do a modified full body, which is back, neck, feet, hands and face.",
  },
  {
    question: "What to expect after a Massage?",
    answer:
      "After a massage you will feel recharged and wonderful. Depending on how deep the therapist was working, you may or may not feel sore the next couple of days. If you do, we advise you to drink plenty of WATER. This is the fluid that the body needs to flush the lactic acid and stagnant fluid out of your body. You may use the bathroom more than usual, but it’s the only liquid that will flush these toxins out. Suggestion if you are not a big water drinker. After everything you normally drink have a water chaser, this will ensure proper hydration.",
  },
  {
    question: "How big is the sheet or blanket that covers me?",
    answer:
      "Twin size sheets fit our massage tables. In the summer months we have a light weight blanket and in the winter months we use a heavy weight blanket in addition to the sheets. If you become too warm, you can always stick your feet out. But the State of South Carolina requires you be draped at all times.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should a person get a massage?",
    answer:
      "This depends on how your body feels. If you have just been in a car accident or fallen down and bumped your knee, you may be in a lot of pain, and we would generally see you a few visits, close together and just short visits, 30 minute sessions, just to get you over the trauma. If you have a chronic, long running pain issue or stressful work and or home life, something that has lasted 3 or more years on a continual basis, you may be a candidate for the 1 time a week for a couple of weeks, for the full one hour session or even the 90 minute session and then your therapist can give you a better idea of when you need to be worked on, maybe once a month. Everyone is different and we should evaluate your situation to let you know what would be best for you and your health. Listen to your body, it will tell you when is best. Finances also play a part in how often you get a massage. If you have little extra money left at the end of your paycheck, then you may be able to come only 3 or 4 times a year. But if you have plenty left over at end of your paycheck, you can come as often as every week!",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a massage ok for pregnant women?",
    answer:
      "Yes. After the first trimester a relaxation massage will help the discomfort that comes with the ever growing baby. Neck, backaches, leg cramps etc., can be very bothersome, and we will be glad to help you through right to your delivery date!",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I do during a massage session?",
    answer:
      "Make yourself comfortable. If your therapist wants to adjust your position, she will either move you or ask you to move what is needed. Otherwise, change your position anytime to make yourself comfortable. Many people close their eyes and relax completely during a session, others prefer to talk. It’s up to you. Do not hesitate to ask questions at any time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I do if I can not make my scheduled appointment?",
    answer:
      "If possible please give your therapist 24 hour notice. Should an emergency arise, please contact us as soon possible. So we can fill your time slot if needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I wear during my massage?",
    answer:
      "Depending on the technique your therapist uses, you may or may not need to undress. For a full body massage most people undress completely or leave their underwear on. Ladies you will have to remove your bra so we can work the entire back. Your massage therapist will give you privacy to undress and slip underneath the covers. Your dignity and privacy are an important part of your comfort, so the only time an area is exposed is when it is being worked on. Breasts and genital areas are NEVER exposed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best way to contact you?",
    answer:
      "The best way to contact us is to call (803) 684-0559 and leave a message on our answering machine. We will call you back as soon as we can. Your call is important to us, so please leave your name, phone number and if you need to schedule a massage appointment or to buy a gift certificate.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should I arrive for my appointment?",
    answer:
      "It is recommended to arrive 5 minutes early so you can fill out our NEW CLIENT HISTORY FORM. This is only one page and asks general questions about health, life style, pain areas and what type of massage you wish to receive. If the door is locked, just have a seat on our bench, we will be with you shortly. First timers plan to stay about ½ hour longer than your scheduled time, so you can have a complete consultation. *You can print out this page and fill out before your scheduled appointment",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I need to leave a phone message?",
    answer:
      "We do not answer the telephone while in session. This is not very respectful of you or the time you have paid for. So leaving a message is the best way to contact us, and we will return your call promptly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is your front door locked?",
    answer:
      "We do not leave your massage to answer the door. We lock our door for your safety and ours. We do not have a full-time receptionist, so please do not bang on the door as it disturbs the relaxed atmosphere for those on the table.",
